# Next.js Menu App

This project is a **Next.js** application that demonstrates the use of **Static Site Generation (SSG)**, **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**, and **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**. It is designed to display a menu with detailed information for each item, showcasing various data fetching strategies provided by Next.js.

## Features

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-renders pages at build time, ideal for displaying menu items with minimal updates.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Fetches data on each request, perfect for pages requiring real-time data, such as user-specific content.
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Automatically revalidates and regenerates static pages after a specified time interval, keeping content fresh without rebuilding the entire site.

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js** - Full-stack React framework
- **React** - Component-based front-end library
- **CSS Modules** - Scoped CSS for styling components
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime for development and API handling
- **Vercel** (Optional) - Recommended platform for Next.js deployment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or later recommended)
- **npm** (or **yarn**)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   
2. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   
3. **Set up environment variables:**

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://api-bfood.vercel.app
   
## Running the Application

1. **Start the development server:**

```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
```
2. **Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000.**

## Data Fetching Strategies

- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** - Used in the main menu page, pre-renders menu items at build time for faster load speeds.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** - Implemented on the categories page to allow filtering on every request, ensuring real-time data based on user-selected criteria.
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):** - Used for individual menu item pages, revalidating data at intervals to keep information up-to-date without a full rebuild.

## Deployment

**For production, this project is optimized for deployment on Vercel. Follow these steps:**
1. Push your code to GitHub or another repository host.
2. Import the project on Vercel and configure your environment variables in Vercelâ€™s settings.
3. Vercel automatically handles Next.js optimizations for best performance.
